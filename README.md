# React Fruits App RTT-2025-04 (in class)

This application, built in React (using Vite) is a full CRUD app meant to be used with an API that we built in class. 
We have 4 custom components:
Fruits - shows ALL fruits in the db
Fruit - shows ONE fruit (by id)
EditFruit - shows a form that is prepopulated with the fruit's information (by id)
CreateFruit - shows a form to create a new fruit

You can find the backend from class [here](https://github.com/tishana/express-fruits-2025-04).
